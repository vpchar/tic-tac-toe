# My Notes:

# (1) The first attempt at asking Chat GPT was a disaster. It was not consistent in the prompt responsees, probably because I asked for readme files and similar, so it was in some "shadow .md" mode. However, it failed

# (2) The second attempt, with the same prompt, failed also. Didn't ask specifically for unbeatable computer.

# (3) The 3rd attempt, in new prompt (chat), I asked propar question. It was "almost" working...and after some code checking I found the problem to be the html code. It forgot to "steal" the id="n" parametters from the decision tree... Anyway, with this small change, the code is officially working(see '1st working commit')
