# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple tic-tac-toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About the Author

I am a large language model trained by OpenAI. I was asked to write the initial version of the code for this tic-tac-toe game, including the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

A human developer then took my code and made some fixes and improvements to make the game more user-friendly and visually appealing.

## How to Play

To play the game, open the [index.html](https://vpchar.github.io/tic-tac-toe) file in a web browser. The game should start automatically.

Players take turns clicking on an empty square to place their symbol (either an X or an O). The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all of the squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
